THE COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS.\\n\\nAPPLE INC. | 2019 FORM 10-K |\\n\\n24\\n\\nOTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS\\n\\nTHE COMPANY’S OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CONSIST OF NONCANCELABLE OBLIGATIONS TO ACQUIRE CAPITAL ASSETS, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT, AND NONCANCELABLE OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO ADVERTISING, LICENSING, R&D, INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, CONTENT CREATION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES.\\n\\nDEEMED REPATRIATION TAX PAYABLE\\n\\nAS OF\\n\\nSEPTEMBER 28, 2019\\n\\n, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET CONSISTED OF THE DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX PAYABLE IMPOSED BY THE ACT. THE COMPANY PLANS TO PAY THE DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX PAYABLE IN INSTALLMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACT.\\n\\nOTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES\\n\\nTHE COMPANY’S REMAINING OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF ITEMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OR AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS; THEREFORE, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TABLE.\\n\\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\\n\\nTHE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (“GAAP”) AND THE COMPANY’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS REQUIRE THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED. NOTE 1, “SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,” OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.\\n\\nMANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY’S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, VALUATION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND ESTIMATION OF INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES, WARRANTY COSTS, INCOME TAXES, AND LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THESE POLICIES CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS. THE COMPANY’S SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\\n\\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\\n\\nTHE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED UP TO THREE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS REGULARLY INCLUDED IN ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVING THE SALE OF IPHONE, MAC, IPAD AND CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTS. THE FIRST PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, WHICH REPRESENTS THE SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE ALLOCATED SALES PRICE, IS THE HARDWARE AND BUNDLED SOFTWARE DELIVERED AT THE TIME OF SALE. THE SECOND PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE CERTAIN PRODUCT-RELATED BUNDLED SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDE ICLOUD, SIRI AND MAPS. THE THIRD PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE, ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS, FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH EACH DEVICE. THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE AND ANY RELATED DISCOUNTS TO THESE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICES (“SSPS”). BECAUSE THE COMPANY LACKS OBSERVABLE PRICES FOR THE UNDELIVERED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE ALLOCATION OF REVENUE IS BASED ON THE COMPANY’S ESTIMATED SSPS. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE PRODUCT-RELATED BUNDLED SERVICES AND UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED.\\n\\nTHE COMPANY’S PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESTIMATED SSPS INVOLVES MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE. SHOULD FUTURE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, THE COMPANY’S SSPS AND THE FUTURE RATE OF RELATED AMORTIZATION FOR PRODUCT-RELATED BUNDLED SERVICES AND UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS RELATED TO FUTURE SALES OF THESE DEVICES COULD CHANGE. FACTORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE INCLUDE THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCT-RELATED BUNDLED SERVICES AND UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS OFFERED, THEIR ESTIMATED VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED.\\n\\nAPPLE INC. | 2019 FORM 10-K |\\n\\n25\\n\\nVALUATION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND ESTIMATION OF INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES\\n\\nTHE COMPANY INVESTS IN MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS, INCLUDING CAPITAL ASSETS HELD AT ITS SUPPLIERS’ FACILITIES AND PREPAYMENTS PROVIDED TO CERTAIN OF ITS SUPPLIERS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS TO SECURE THE SUPPLY OF INVENTORY. THE COMPANY ALSO ACCRUES ESTIMATED PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO INVENTORY ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELED OR ARE EXPECTED TO BE CANCELED. THE COMPANY’S ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS ARE THE KEY INPUTS IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE ADEQUACY OF ANY PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEE ACCRUALS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN ESTIMATED DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS, A CHANGE IN THE COMPANY’S PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, OR AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD WRITE-DOWNS OR IMPAIRMENTS OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS OR ACCRUE PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES.\\n\\nWARRANTY COSTS\\n\\nTHE COMPANY OFFERS LIMITED WARRANTIES ON ITS NEW HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND ON PARTS USED TO REPAIR ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS, AND CUSTOMERS MAY PURCHASE EXTENDED SERVICE COVERAGE, WHERE AVAILABLE, ON MANY OF THE COMPANY’S HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY ACCRUES THE ESTIMATED COST OF WARRANTIES IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST PER CLAIM AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES OUTSIDE THE COMPANY’S TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITIES WOULD BE REQUIRED.\\n\\nINCOME TAXES\\n\\nTHE COMPANY RECOGNIZES TAX BENEFITS FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER-THAN-50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF GAAP AND COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT’S EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.\\n\\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\\n\\nAS DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS” AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTE 10, “COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES,” THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE DETERMINATION OF WHICH REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTE 10, “COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES” UNDER THE HEADING “CONTINGENCIES,” IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS GREATER THAN A RECORDED ACCRUAL, CONCERNING LOSS CONTINGENCIES FOR ASSERTED LEGAL AND OTHER CLAIMS.\\n\\nTHE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. IF ONE OR MORE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS ABOVE MANAGEMENT’S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.'"
