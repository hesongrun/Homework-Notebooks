" As consumers learn more about non-local builders, high-quality builders gain market share and grow, while low-quality firms exit"
" The results have implications for electoral competition and are potentially actionable for policymakers"
" We present instrumental-variables estimates that also show no causal effect of income on democracy"

" Players compete for one of several identical prizes by choosing a score"
" I demonstrate that the tightness of this constraint depends on the nature of belief disagreements"
" Identification is obtained by firm rank conditional mobility and wage patterns"
" We possess unique data that allow us to measure relative student performance in mandatory follow-on classes"
" I use the framework to analyse economies with rare disasters, and argue that the importance of such disasters is a double-edged sword: parameters that govern the frequency and sizes of rare disasters are critically important for asset pricing, but extremely hard to calibrate"
" It is an empirically robust middle ground between the two approaches that estimates economically interpretable and policy-relevant dynamic treatment effects that account for heterogeneity in cognitive and noncognitive skills and the continuation values of educational choices"
" I conduct an experiment designed to distinguish between and test these alternative explanations"
" Sustained growth comes from the feedback between the endogenously determined distribution of productivity, as evolved from past search decisions, and an optimal, forward-looking search policy"
" We characterize the set of equilibrium profits attainable for the seller as the period length vanishes"
" The asymptotic framework is intended to approximate a small sample phenomenon: even though the total number n of observations may be large, the number of effective observations local to the cut-off is often small"
" Such nonlinearity may arise for a variety of reasons, including weak identification"

" Due to his overconfidence, the agenteven if initially correctbecomes too pessimistic about the fundamental"
" data, the bond market\'s q fits the investment equation six times better than the usual measure of q, it drives out cash flows, and it reduces the implied adjustment costs by more than an order of magnitude"
"We study intertemporal price discrimination when consumers can store for future consumption needs"
