" It is argued that the definition is well-suited to modelling within the Savage (as opposed to Anscombe and Aumann) domain of acts"
" The economy is subject to an information externality but uncertainty traps may remain in the efficient allocation"
" One advantage of this model is that the well-developed machinery for dealing with risk attitudes can be applied as well to ambiguity attitudes"
" Harmonization of state taxes within Census regions achieves most of these gains"
" We generalize Rosen\'s first stage to account for product characteristics that are not observed and to allow the hedonic pricing function to have a general nonseparable form"
" Given the difficulty of calculating the relationship between school quality and student outcomes, I turn to another method and use house prices to infer the value parents place on school quality"
" The relative revenue rankings of the auction formats can go in either direction, depending on the specifics of the environment"
"We introduce and solve a new class of \""downward-recursive\"" static portfolio choice problems"
" We show that these interactions can have important implications which are consistent with observed phenomena in both the micro and macro environments"
" Two, we identify conditions on the technology of conflict, network value function, and the resource configuration for which networks with multiple hubs/components are optimal"
" The analogous conclusions are drawn for a smooth divergence CE, based on a formulation of Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Rustichini, but only under Brownian uncertainty"
" Workers\' productivity is assumed to consist of observed and unobserved components"
" We show that this is an artifact of the presumption that information is independently distributed"
" By contrast, Social Security benefit levels, health, and borrowing constraints are less important determinants of job exit at older ages"
" Smaller and more open economies are more prone to suffer from inflationary shocks"
" Changes in assumed returns, in turn, influence pension plan asset allocations"
" They secure a higher welfare level from regionalism than from free trade achieved multilaterally; nonmembers, however, reach a lower welfare level"
" Using a simple model, I show that these findings are consistent with a view of the kibbutz as providing optimal insurance when members have the option of leaving"
" We show that mechanisms that centralize production decisions are strictly dominated by those that decentralize decision-making authority to agents, and optimal communication mechanisms maximize information exchanged directly among agents"
" In multi-unit auctions, bids for marginal units may affect payments for inframarginal units, giving rise to \""demand reduction\"" and furthermore to incentives for shading bids differently across units"
" We adapt Futia\'s (1981) frequency domain methods to derive conditions on the fundamentals that guarantee non-invertibility of the mapping between observed market data and the underlying shocks to agents\' information sets"
" We characterize sustainable and unsustainable outcomes, study the effects of changes in the discount factor, investigate efficiency properties, and explore the potential for achieving renegotiation-proof outcomes"
" The main quantitative result is that credit expansions and contractions have contributed to moderately deeper and more protracted recessions over the last 40 years"
" Most restructuring measures do not increase price and delay privatization further"
" However, even mild exclusion restrictions generate strong implications that can be used to test the Nash bargaining assumption"
" Evidence from a regression discontinuity design suggests that advertising affects election results by altering the partisan composition of the electorate"
