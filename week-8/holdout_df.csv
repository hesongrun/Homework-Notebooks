ON THE PREVALENCE OF LABOR CONTRACTS WITH FIXED DURATION,"The prevalence of labor contracts with fixed duration seems surprising.  Why is a fixed duration preferred to a stochastic duration that depends on the consumer price index?  In this paper, the specification of the contract duration is determined endogeneously.  The wage rate can be indexed to the consumer price index, but there is a loss since the indexation must be the same for different types of shocks.  This loss increases with the variability of the contract duration.  Since the loss due to the contracting cost depends on the expected discounted duration only, a fixed duration is chosen.",0,The prevalence of labor contracts with fixed duration seems surprising,AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

INTERTEMPORAL ASSET PRICING WITHOUT CONSUMPTION DATA,"This paper proposes a new way to generalize the insights of static asset pricing theory to a multiperiod setting. The paper uses a loglinear approximation to the budget constraint to substitute out consumption from a standard intertemporal asset pricing model. In a homoscedastic lognormal setting, the consumption-wealth ratio is shown to depend on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption, while asset risk premia are determined by the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Risk premia are related to the covariances of asset returns with the market return and with news about the discounted value of all future market returns.",1,This paper proposes a new way to generalize the insights of static asset pricing theory to a multiperiod setting,AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

RATIONAL ASSET-PRICE MOVEMENTS WITHOUT NEWS,"This paper argues that an important part of movements in asset prices may be caused by neither external news nor irrationality, but by the revelation of information by the trading process itself. Two models are developed that illustrate this general idea. One model is based on investor uncertainty about the quality of other investors\' information; the other is based on widespread dispersion of information and small costs to trading. The analysis is used to suggest a possible rational explanation of the October 1987 crash.",1,"This paper argues that an important part of movements in asset prices may be caused by neither external news nor irrationality, but by the revelation of information by the trading process itself",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

LIMITED MARKET PARTICIPATION AND VOLATILITY OF ASSET PRICES,"Traditional asset-pricing theories assume complete market participation, despite considerable empirical evidence that most investors participate in a limited number of markets. We show that once the participation decision is endogenized, market properties change dramatically. First, limited market participation can amplify the effect of liquidity trading relative to full participation; under certain circumstances, an arbitrarily small aggregate liquidity shock can cause significant price volatility. Second, there exist multiple equilibria with very different participation regimes and levels of asset-price volatility. Third, under plausible conditions the equilibria can be Pareto-ranked; the Pareto-preferred equilibrium is characterized by greater participation and lower volatility.",1,"Traditional asset-pricing theories assume complete market participation, despite considerable empirical evidence that most investors participate in a limited number of markets",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

"EQUAL DIVISION, EFFICIENCY, AND THE SOVEREIGN SUPPLY OF LABOR","The canonical problem of equity in production economies consists of two agents with different tastes and abilities, each of whom contributes labor to produce a single consumption good. As a criterion for distributive justice, I require that if both agents work equal numbers of hours, they should divide the output equally. I also require that the labor-supply decision should remain sovereign. Sufficient conditions are established for achieving an efficient allocation using a division procedure that is consistent with the equal-division-for-equal-work principle, and it is shown that the conditions are satisfied in many standard economies.",0,"The canonical problem of equity in production economies consists of two agents with different tastes and abilities, each of whom contributes labor to produce a single consumption good",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

"RISK-TAKING, GLOBAL DIVERSIFICATION, AND GROWTH","This paper develops a continuous-time stochastic model in which international risk-sharing can yield substantial welfare gains through its effect on expected consumption growth.  The mechanism linking global diversification to growth is an attendant world portfolio shift from safe low-yield capital to riskier high-yield capital.  The presence of these two types of capital captures the idea that growth depends on the availability of an ever-increasing array of specialized, hence inherently risky, production inputs.  Calibration exercises using consumption and stock-market data imply that most countries reap large steady-state welfare gains from global financial integration.",1,This paper develops a continuous-time stochastic model in which international risk-sharing can yield substantial welfare gains through its effect on expected consumption growth,AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

"INCOME RISK, BORROWING CONSTRAINTS, AND PORTFOLIO CHOICE","Economic theory suggests that uninsurable income risk and the expectation of future borrowing constraints can reduce the share of risky assets in a household\'s portfolio. If the utility function exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion and decreasing prudence, an individual will reduce his exposure to rate of return risks when confronted with other independent risks. If there are transaction costs, the expectation of future borrowing constraints should induce individuals to keep a lower proportion of their wealth in the form of illiquid and risky assets.

CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS' LABOR SUPPLY: EVIDENCE FROM EXOGENOUS VARIATION IN FAMILY SIZE,Research on the labor-supply consequences of childbearing is complicated by the endogeneity of fertility. This study uses parental preferences for a mixed sibling-sex composition to construct instrumental variables (IV) estimates of the effect of childbearing on labor supply. IV estimates for women are significant but smaller than ordinary least-squares estimates. The IV are also smaller for more educated women and show no impact of family size on husbands\' labor supply. A comparison of estimates using sibling-sex composition and twins instruments implies that the impact of a third child disappears when the child reaches age 13.,0,Research on the labor-supply consequences of childbearing is complicated by the endogeneity of fertility,AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

MULTIDIMENSIONAL UNCERTAINTY AND HERD BEHAVIOR IN FINANCIAL MARKETS,"We study the relationship between asset prices and herd behavior, which occurs when traders follow the trend in past trades. When traders have private information on only a single dimension of uncertainty (the effect of a shock to the asset value), price adjustments prevent herd behavior. Herding arises when there are two dimensions of uncertainty (the existence and effect of a shock), but it need not distort prices because the market discounts the informativeness of trades during herding.

We find that despite the existence of liquidity constraints; standard investment regressions predict that cash flow is an important determinant of investment only if one ignores q.

"TESTING INTERTEMPORAL SUBSTITUTION, IMPLICIT CONTRACTS, AND HOURS RESTRICTION MODELS OF THE LABOR MARKET USING MICRO DATA","We present new tests of three theories of the labor market: intertemporal substitution, hours restrictions, and implicit contracts. The intertemporal substitution test we implement is an exclusion test robust to many specification errors and we consistently reject this model. We model hours restrictions as part of an endogenous switching model. We compare the implicit probit equation to an unrestricted probit equation for unemployment and reject the hours restriction model. For the implicit contracts model, we estimate nonseparable within-period labor-supply and consumption equations. We test a cross-equation restriction of the model and cannot reject the implicit contracts model.",0,"We present new tests of three theories of the labor market: intertemporal substitution, hours restrictions, and implicit contracts",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

IN-KIND FINANCE: A THEORY OF TRADE CREDIT,"It is typically less profitable for an opportunistic borrower to divert inputs than to divert cash. Therefore, suppliers may lend more liberally than banks. This simple argument is at the core of our contract theoretic model of trade credit in competitive markets.

DO POLICE REDUCE CRIME? ESTIMATES USING THE ALLOCATION OF POLICE FORCES AFTER A TERRORIST ATTACK,"An important challenge in the crime literature is to isolate causal effects of police on crime.

ZOMBIE LENDING AND DEPRESSED RESTRUCTURING IN JAPAN,"Large Japanese banks often engaged in sham loan restructurings that kept credit flowing to otherwise insolvent borrowers (which we call zombies). We examine the implications of suppressing the normal competitive process whereby the zombies would shed workers and lose market share.

STOCKS AS LOTTERIES: THE IMPLICATIONS OF PROBABILITY WEIGHTING FOR SECURITY PRICES,"We study the asset pricing implications of Tversky and Kahneman\'s (1992) cumulative prospect theory, with a particular focus on its probability weighting component. Our main result, derived from a novel equilibrium with nonunique global optima, is that, in contrast to the prediction of a standard expected utility model, a security\'s own skewness can be priced: a positively skewed security can be \""overpriced\"" and can earn a negative average excess return. We argue that our analysis offers a unifying way of thinking about a number of seemingly unrelated financial phenomena.",1,"We study the asset pricing implications of Tversky and Kahneman\'s (1992) cumulative prospect theory, with a particular focus on its probability weighting component",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

LIQUIDITY AND INSURANCE FOR THE UNEMPLOYED,"We study unemployment insurance for workers who sequentially sample job opportunities. We focus on the optimal timing of benefits and the desirability of allowing borrowing and saving. When workers have constant absolute risk aversion, a simple policy is optimal: a constant benefit during unemployment, a constant tax during employment, and free access to a riskless asset. With constant relative risk aversion, optimal policy involves nearly constant benefits; more elaborate policies offer minuscule welfare gains.

SOVEREIGN RISK AND SECONDARY MARKETS,"Conventional wisdom says that, in the absence of default penalties, sovereign risk destroys all foreign asset trade. We show that this conventional wisdom rests on one implicit assumption: that assets cannot be retraded in secondary markets.

IS THE VOLATILITY OF THE MARKET PRICE OF RISK DUE TO INTERMITTENT PORTFOLIO REBALANCING?,"Our paper examines whether the failure of unsophisticated investors to rebalance their portfolios can help to explain the countercyclical volatility of aggregate risk compensation in financial markets. To answer this question, we set up a model in which a large mass of investors do not rebalance their portfolio shares in response to aggregate shocks, while a smaller mass of active investors do. We find that intermittent rebalancers more than double the effect of aggregate shocks on the time variation in risk premia by forcing active traders to sell more shares in good times and buy more shares in bad times.

DOES DISABILITY INSURANCE RECEIPT DISCOURAGE WORK?

MEASURING THE IMPACTS OF TEACHERS II: TEACHER VALUE-ADDED AND STUDENT OUTCOMES IN ADULTHOOD,"Are teachers\' impacts on students\' test scores (value-added) a good measure of their quality? This question has sparked debate partly because of a lack of evidence on whether high value-added (VA) teachers improve students\' long-term outcomes. Using school district and tax records for more than one million children, we find that students assigned to high-VA teachers are more likely to attend college, earn higher salaries, and are less likely to have children as teenagers. Replacing a teacher whose VA is in the bottom 5 percent with an average teacher would increase the present value of students\' lifetime income by approximately $250,000 per classroom.",0,Are teachers\' impacts on students\' test scores (value-added) a good measure of their quality?

"FEEDBACK EFFECTS, ASYMMETRIC TRADING, AND THE LIMITS TO ARBITRAGE","We analyze strategic speculators\' incentives to trade on information in a model where firm value is endogenous to trading, due to feedback from the financial market to corporate decisions. Trading reveals private information to managers and improves their real decisions, enhancing fundamental value. This feedback effect has an asymmetric effect on trading behavior: it increases (reduces) the profitability of buying (selling) on good (bad) news. This gives rise to an endogenous limit to arbitrage, whereby investors may refrain from trading on negative information. Thus, bad news is incorporated more slowly into prices than good news, potentially leading to overinvestment.",1,"We analyze strategic speculators\' incentives to trade on information in a model where firm value is endogenous to trading, due to feedback from the financial market to corporate decisions",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

AN EMPIRICAL MODEL OF THE MEDICAL MATCH,"This paper develops a framework for estimating preferences in a many-to-one matching market using only observed matches. I use pairwise stability and a vertical preference restriction on one side to identify preferences on both sides of the market. Counterfactual simulations are used to analyze the antitrust allegation that the centralized medical residency match is responsible for salary depression. Due to residents\' willingness to pay for desirable programs and capacity constraints, salaries in any competitive equilibrium would remain, on average, at least $23,000 below the marginal product of labor.

We show that the competitive equilibrium price underreacts to information when there is a bound to the amount of money traders are allowed to invest. Underreaction is more pronounced when prior beliefs are more heterogeneous. Even in the absence of exogenous bounds on the amount that traders can invest, prices underreact to information provided that traders become less risk averse as their wealth increases.

ON THE TIMING AND PRICING OF DIVIDENDS: REPLY,"Schulz (2016) replicates the findings of van Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2012)-henceforth, BBK-and agrees that the average pretax returns on short-term dividend strips are higher than those of the index, but argues that the after-tax returns are not. He thus provides a possible economic interpretation of the results in BBK: taxes. Schulz (2016) estimates the differential tax rates of dividends versus capital gains from ex-dividend day returns.

"PARTNER CHOICE, INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN, AND THE MARITAL COLLEGE PREMIUM","We construct a model of household decision-making in which agents consume a private and a public good, interpreted as children\'s welfare. Children\'s utility depends on their human capital, which depends on the time their parents spend with them and on the parents\' human capital. We first show that as returns to human capital increase, couples at the top of the income distribution should spend more time with their children. This in turn should reinforce assortative matching, in a sense that we precisely define. We then embed the model into a transferable utility matching framework with random preferences, a la Choo and Siow (2006), which we estimate using US marriage data for individuals born between 1943 and 1972. We find that the preference for partners of the same education has significantly increased for white individuals, particularly for the highly educated. We find no evidence of such an increase for black individuals.

"PARTNER CHOICE, INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN, AND THE MARITAL COLLEGE PREMIUM","We construct a model of household decision-making in which agents consume a private and a public good, interpreted as children\'s welfare. Children\'s utility depends on their human capital, which depends on the time their parents spend with them and on the parents\' human capital.

This in turn should reinforce assortative matching, in a sense that we precisely define. We then embed the model into a transferable utility matching framework with random preferences, a la Choo and Siow (2006), which we estimate using US marriage data for individuals born between 1943 and 1972.

"THE EFFECTS OF PRETRIAL DETENTION ON CONVICTION, FUTURE CRIME, AND EMPLOYMENT: EVIDENCE FROM RANDOMLY ASSIGNED JUDGES","Over 20 percent of prison and jail inmates in the United States are currently awaiting trial, but little is known about the impact of pretrial detention on defendants. This paper uses the detention tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to estimate the causal effects of retrial detention on subsequent defendant outcomes. Using data from administrative court and tax records, we find that pretrial detention significantly increases the probability of conviction, primarily through an increase in guilty pleas. Pretrial detention has no net effect on future crime, but decreases formal sector employment and the receipt of employment- and tax-related government benefits. These results are consistent with (i) pretrial detention weakening defendants\' bargaining positions during plea negotiations and (ii) a criminal conviction lowering defendants\' prospects in the formal labor market.",0,"Over 20 percent of prison and jail inmates in the United States are currently awaiting trial, but little is known about the impact of pretrial detention on defendants",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

These results are consistent with (i) pretrial detention weakening defendants\' bargaining positions during plea negotiations and (ii) a criminal conviction lowering defendants\' prospects in the formal labor market.",0," Pretrial detention has no net effect on future crime, but decreases formal sector employment and the receipt of employment- and tax-related government benefits",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
"THE EFFECTS OF PRETRIAL DETENTION ON CONVICTION, FUTURE CRIME, AND EMPLOYMENT: EVIDENCE FROM RANDOMLY ASSIGNED JUDGES","Over 20 percent of prison and jail inmates in the United States are currently awaiting trial, but little is known about the impact of pretrial detention on defendants. This paper uses the detention tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to estimate the causal effects of retrial detention on subsequent defendant outcomes. Using data from administrative court and tax records, we find that pretrial detention significantly increases the probability of conviction, primarily through an increase in guilty pleas. Pretrial detention has no net effect on future crime, but decreases formal sector employment and the receipt of employment- and tax-related government benefits.

THE LONG-RUN EFFECTS OF DISRUPTIVE PEERS,"A large and growing literature has documented the importance of peer effects in education. However, there is relatively little evidence on the long-run educational and labor market consequences of childhood peers. We examine this question by linking administrative data on elementary school students to subsequent test scores, college attendance and completion, and earnings. To distinguish the effect of peers from confounding factors, we exploit the population variation in the proportion of children from families linked to domestic violence, who have been shown to disrupt contemporaneous behavior and learning. Results show that exposure to a disruptive peer in classes of 25 during elementary school reduces earnings at age 24 to 28 by 3 percent. We estimate that differential exposure to children linked to domestic violence explains 5 percent of the rich-poor earnings gap in our data, and that each year of exposure to a disruptive peer reduces the present discounted value of classmates\' future earnings by $80,000.",0,A large and growing literature has documented the importance of peer effects in education,AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

THE HUMAN CAPITAL STOCK: A GENERALIZED APPROACH: REPLY,"Human capital differences across countries can appear large or small depending on measurement methods. This Reply clarifies key assumptions and conceptual distinctions across accounting approaches. Accounting-based arguments for small human capital differences are difficult to sustain. By contrast, large human capital differences are theoretically and empirically coherent. Non-accounting arguments against large human capital variation are examined and their weaknesses pinpointed. This Reply also suggests a fruitful way forward for this literature, providing a natural conception of human capital that integrates literatures on ideas and institutions with the accounting of Jones (2014).",0,Human capital differences across countries can appear large or small depending on measurement methods,AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

THE HUMAN CAPITAL STOCK: A GENERALIZED APPROACH: COMMENT,"Jones (2014) examines development accounting with imperfect substitutability between different types of skills in the production of output. He finds that human capital variation can account for the totality of the variation in income across countries. We show that this finding is entirely due to an assumption that the relative wage of skilled workers is solely determined by attributes of workers (once the supply of skilled workers is accounted for). If skill premia are predominantly determined by technology, institutions, and other features of the economic environment, human capital differences explain none of the variation in income per worker.",0,Jones (2014) examines development accounting with imperfect substitutability between different types of skills in the production of output,AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

ALCOHOL AND SELF-CONTROL: A FIELD EXPERIMENT IN INDIA,"This paper studies alcohol consumption among low-income workers in India. In a 3-week field experiment, the majority of 229 cycle-rickshaw drivers were willing to forgo substantial monetary payments in order to set incentives for themselves to remain sober, thus exhibiting demand for commitment to sobriety. Randomly receiving sobriety incentives significantly reduced daytime drinking while leaving overall drinking unchanged. I find no evidence of higher daytime sobriety significantly changing labor supply, productivity, or earnings. In contrast, increasing sobriety raised savings by 50 percent, an effect that does not appear to be solely explained by changes in income net of alcohol expenditures.

"BARGAINING OVER BABIES: THEORY, EVIDENCE, AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS","It takes a woman and a man to make a baby. This fact suggests that for a birth to take place, the parents should first agree on wanting a child. Using newly available data on fertility preferences and outcomes, we show that indeed, babies are likely to arrive only if both parents desire one. In addition, there are many couples who disagree on having babies, and in low-fertility countries women are much more likely than men to be opposed to having another child. We account for this evidence with a quantitative model of household bargaining in which the distribution of the burden of child care between mothers and fathers is a key determinant of fertility. The model implies that fertility is highly responsive to targeted policies that lower the child care burden specifically for mothers.",0,It takes a woman and a man to make a baby,AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
